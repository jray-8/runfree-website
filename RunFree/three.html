                    Hopefully, you are now aware of all the reasons to start running, but how do you actually start? Luckily, running is a very straight forward exercise. 
                    All you have to do is move your arms and legs and move your body onwards. It seems simple because that’s all it really takes. Don’t worry too much about 
                    having “perfect form” or the intricacies of your arm and leg alignment, when starting out. Simply start moving forwards at a comfortable pace and let your body 
                    do what ever feels natural.

                    There’s no <i>correct</i> way to run, you just need to start doing it and you will figure out what works for you! And of course, you will get better in time as 
                    your body gets familiar with this exercise. So, don’t feel discouraged if your first few runs feel awkward or difficult, keep training!

                    Running is just a slightly faster and more involved jog, however it’s a good idea to start off by jogging, or even speed walking, until you feel perfectly 
                    comfortable with what you’re doing. Then you can jump to the next stage. Also, remember to not overwork yourself on your first two weeks of running. You first need 
                    to observe what your body is actually capable of, expand your lung capacity and stimulate your muscles before you start to push yourself. This all happens naturally 
                    after about two weeks of running, and afterwards you can start increasing your effort, speed or distance. So, start slow and work your way up to faster and longer runs, 
                    then you can aim to break your personal records. Your cardiovascular system will slowly adapt to handle more extreme workouts. So, wait a few weeks while your body gets 
                    used to this level of intensity before attempting to push yourself.

                    As you get more serious with running, you can try to focus on taking deeper breaths, larger strides by swinging your arms further, and concentrating on forcing your 
                    feet through the ground. This will allow you to pick up the pace and run better. It is also imperative to start stretching and warming up, as your running improves. 
                    You want to avoid injuries and prepare your body for your next run. There are many great stretches on the internet or YouTube that are quite easy to find by searching 
                    for “stretches for runners”. These fundamentals are all you need to proceed on your running journey and keep improving. Now, it’s time to put that knowledge to the test and run!
