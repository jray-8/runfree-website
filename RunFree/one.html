                <h3>Regulates the Body’s Natural Cycles</h3>
                <p>
                    Running is the most primitive exercise known to man. Our bodies were designed to run long distances so that we can hunt meat, 
                    pursuing new territory covered with animals. Suitably, running puts our bodies into a totally natural position and stimulates our biological senses. 
                    Research shows that running can benefit your circadian rhythm, supporting your wake-sleep cycle, and providing you with a better night’s sleep. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, running can help balance your blood sugar levels, and is great for those with diabetes. While running, the body is constantly 
                    converting the glycogen in your muscles into usable energy. Over time, if you run frequently, your body will learn to store the sugar in a more 
                    efficient manner in your muscles, ultimately reducing the amount sugar left in your bloodstream. You will also become more sensitive to insulin for 24 hours 
                    to 5 days after a run, preventing it from spiking. Running can also improve and maintain your vision by increasing the flow of blood through the optic nerve. 
                    Lastly, running promotes good digestive health and keeps everything flowing steadily. So, go for a daily run to regulate the processes of the body and let nature do its thing.
                </p>

                <h3>Releases Tension</h3>
                <p>
                    Everyone stores substantial tension in the body, however most people are unaware of this. And the mind is a reflection of the body, 
                    so if we have tension in our body we will feel more obstructed and strained mentally as well. If you consciously tell your body to 
                    “let go” right now, you will likely slouch back into a much different position than what you were in while reading this. And you will 
                    notice how much tightness is contained in all our muscles even when we aren’t doing anything. The majority of people’s bodies are tense 
                    and stiff because our daily lives involve a lot of sitting, staring at screens and lingering in the same position for long periods of time. 
                    You can test how much tension is in your body by stretching and observing how flexible you are. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running uses all the muscles in our body and stretches them as we twist and turn our bodies each stride. 
                    This allows us to target the muscles we use infrequently, stretching and strengthening them. Furthermore, after a long run 
                    our muscles get tired and want to expand to recover from the workout. This will prompt us to release tension that may not have been freed otherwise. 
                    So, a short run every now and then will help us keep the tension out of our bodies, and in turn will make us feel physically relaxed and mentally at ease.

                <h3>Heal Faster & Prevent Injury / Illness</h3>
                <p>
                    Running keeps you in shape, which obviously is better for your overall physical health, but running can also modify your body in ways that seem almost supernatural. 
                    When we run, our bodies operate on a hyperactive level, circulating white blood cells throughout the body faster to attack bacteria, viruses and fungi. 
                    This boosts our immune system and can help you avoid viruses and infections, but you must trigger this process regularly for the greatest benefit. 
                    Running can even prevent you from developing a cold if you run before symptoms set in. You can also reduce the risk of many diseases by running. Diabetes, obesity, 
                    many heart-related conditions, and even cancer is less likely to be acquired by those who run consistently. Studies have even shown that people who run generally live 
                    longer than those who do not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running trains our bodies to recover faster and strengthens our bones, as we adapt to the frequent stress and recovery process. This will help prevent you from getting injured 
                    in the future, from falling or playing sports, or will at least lessen the severity of the injury. Furthermore, running circulates the blood effectively, providing all parts of the 
                    body with all the nutrition and components it needs to rebuild and sustain itself. This will help you heal faster from cuts or bruises. Ultimately, running will make your body tougher 
                    and more resilient to damage.

                <h3>Burns Calories & Builds Muscle</h3>
                <p>
                    Of course, running is also great for getting into shape and staying fit. Since running requires us to continuously move our entire body, 
                    it takes a tremendous amount of energy to run. Even if we aren’t moving that fast, our bodies are heavy, and it takes energy to move heavy objects 
                    over a distance – it’s mathematical. Additionally, running moves our legs, our arms, twists are shoulders and back, and flexes are abs and glutes for stability 
                    with each step. All this muscle activation at once forces our bodies to burn a relatively large sum of calories over a short duration. This is why running is one 
                    of the best exercises for burning calories, because you get the most bang for you buck. It doesn’t matter how slow you go, if you cover a large distance you will 
                    end up depleting a lot of calories. So, if your primary goal is losing weight, find a way to make your run enjoyable, then go at a comfortable, easy pace and start 
                    doing this often. When combined with a low-calorie diet, you lose a significant amount of fat in no time! 
                </p>
                <img class="float-left rounded" src="diet.jpg" alt="assorted healthy foods">
                <p class="top-space">
                    If your more focused on strength and getting bigger, then don’t worry because running will certainly build muscle over time. And this exercise is a great way to do it 
                    since running targets all the muscles in your body at once. However, running develops muscle in a different way than lifting weights does, as running is an aerobic exercise. 
                    When you are running, your muscles become deprived of oxygen and sugar over time, prompting the growth of new muscle fibres to let you store more sugar in your muscles and oxidize 
                    glucose more efficiently. This process is called hyperplasia. Whereas standard weightlifting puts muscles under stress, causing microtears in the muscle fibre, which then prompts an 
                    increase in the size of muscle cells. This is called hypertrophy. Running does put your muscles under moderate stress, especially if you are running on concrete or up hills, so 
                    it is still possible to gain muscle this way, although it has an upper limit. In any case, running will help build your muscles, making you stronger, and keeping you lean in the process!

                <h3>Improves Cardiovascular Fitness</h3>
                <p>
                    Strengthen your heart and let it pump blood throughout your body with less effort. Running will lower your resting heart rate 
                    because your heart will be able to do more work with each beat. This will help to lower your blood pressure in the long run and keep your organs healthy. 
                    Plus, normal blood pressure has many advantages of its own, such as reducing stress and avoiding heart attacks, strokes, and kidney or cognitive problems. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, running gradually expands your lung capacity since the body requires more and more oxygen at once, as you begin running faster. The average 
                    person only breathes from their chest and takes shallow breathes, using a smaller portion of their lung capacity. However, each run will fortify your diaphragm 
                    and cause your lungs to expand a bit more than they are used to. Eventually, you will be taking deeper breathes from your diaphragm when you’re just lounging around 
                    the house, and you won’t even notice that your breathes are fuller. But you will unquestionably feel the impact. With more oxygen in your body, you will get fewer 
                    headaches, stop feeling lethargic or tired, and the appearance of your skin will improve. You will generally have more energy and feel positive. And of course, 
                    running will increase your stamina over time, making you able to do any exercise longer and enhance your athletic abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another great effect of running is the act of flowing blood through your body faster, for a period of time. This will distribute nutrients to all parts of your body 
                    and improve the circulation of your extremities. As a result of this process, you will have less soreness or muscle aches, increased mobility in your joints and 
                    improved nerve function. This is very beneficial for arthritis. In addition, good circulation expels toxins from the body and keeps your organs functioning properly, 
                    while replenishing the natural oils in your hair, nails and skin.
