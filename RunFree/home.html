                    Free your mind from negativity and you will soar! Running is more than an exercise, but a way of connecting the mind, 
                    body and soul to enhance your life. Runners that understand this have gone on to accomplish extraordinary things. 
                    It is our mission here at RunFree to get you excited about running. We want to spread our passion of fitness and its rich benefits to everyone. 
                    We teach children why they need to stay active, so that they can embark on a life of energy and happiness from a young age. We also mentor older 
                    men and women who need our help getting started on their fitness journey. We supply our clients with the fundamentals so that they can continue to 
                    train and advance without us. Learn more about what we do <a href="six.html">here</a>.

                <h2>Why Should I Start Running?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Running requires no equipment and can be done anywhere. Just put on some running shoes, head out the door, and you’re ready to go.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It can be fun! Running is a very social exercise, and a great way to meet new people or catch up with your family or friends. 
                            Nobody said you can’t go running with your buddies! Or if you prefer to run solo, you can zone out to your music or listen to an audio book. 
                            This is also a great time to reflect on things or let your mind wander, as you’re alone with your thoughts and nothing else to distract you. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            Running has several long-term health benefits, both for the body and mind. If you run consistently, you can positively transform your life 
                            and progressively shape your body. On the journey, you will become more confident in your abilities and attain an optimistic attitude. 
                            And the best part is that the qualities you gain while running can be applied to any other part of your life. 
                            And nothing beats the heavenly feeling of relaxing after a long run!
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            It’s exciting! You get to see new things when your running, appreciate nature, and discover new places. Unlike other exercises that keep 
                            you in one area, running lets you travel as far as your desire. 
                        </p>

                            There’s always a new way to train! You don’t have to run the same way, at the same place each time you go out for a run. That’s the beauty of this exercise. 
                            You can run faster or slower, shorter or longer, up hills or around a lake, and you can visit a new location each time. 
                            Mixing up your routine is a great way to keep you motivated and make your workout fun. 
                        </p>

                            You can enter events such as marathon or races to put your work to the test and meet new people who share your interest. 
                            There are also several charities that you can run for to help support a cause you believe in.
