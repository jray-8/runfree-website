                <h3>Eliminates Stress</h3>
                <p>
                    Running is excellent for clearing your mind and leaving you in a better mood. Its easy to forget about any trouble that was on your mind prior 
                    to running because it takes continual focus to keep our bodies moving, especially when we are getting tired. Consequently, it is very difficult to 
                    pay attention to any negative thoughts as we run. Instead, we are forced to be aware of our surroundings – the wind rushing against us, the trees passing by, 
                    and the path we are running on. Taking a small break from the busyness modern society can release the tension we hold in our minds and let us get back to our 
                    responsibilities with a fresh perspective.

                <h3>Meditative</h3>
                <p>
                    The repetitive rhythm of hitting your feet against the ground and the droning pattern of breathing in and out can ease our minds into a state of meditation. 
                    This is great for emptying our minds and helping us live in the moment. Often times, our heads are packed with a million thoughts and things we need to get done 
                    throughout the day. This meditative exercise allows us to work things out subconsciously and give our minds a chance to catch up with the rest of our life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, since running uses so much energy and brain power to perform, when you’re recovering for the few hours after a run, a wave of tranquility will fill your 
                    body and give you a true sense of peace. This is a perfect time to reflect on things, relax or concentrate on another activity. 
                    Meditation is also known to improve attitude, productivity, and focus over time.
                </p>

                <h3>Stimulates Creativity and Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    Getting the blood flowing in the body and signals firing through the mind is often a quick trick to stir up some new ideas for projects, 
                    art, music, or any other hobbies that you have. As much as physical exercise works our muscles, it also requires a lot of brain power to 
                    trigger the nerves that activate our muscles. And running is an exercise that uses the most nerve function because when running we are moving all 
                    parts of our body – our arms, legs, shoulders, abs, glutes, and even our chest and back. For this reason, the few hours after running, our minds are 
                    hyperactive and full of energy, making it easier to start our chores or look at things from different angles. So, if you ever feel yourself procrastinating or 
                    getting writer’s block, your solution could be one run away!

                <h3>Alleviates Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression</h3>
                <p>
                    There have been numerous studies investigating the effects of exercise on the mind, specifically the chemicals that the brain releases when 
                    partaking in physical activity. It has been shown on multiple occasions that running releases endorphins, a hormone that acts as a natural pain killer 
                    and is responsible for making us feel happy. This effect is powerful and can seriously bring the mind out of a rut. Although running only triggers these 
                    hormones temporarily, this is sometimes enough of an opening for someone experiencing depression or anxiety to turn things around or seek more help. 
                    Additionally, if done everyday, or at least a few times per week, running can help balance the body’s hormones long-term, which will fight these mental illnesses from the source.
                </p>

                <h3>Boosts Confidence</h3>
                <p>
                    Working out is so difficult because no matter how fit you are, you can always push yourself harder. And nobody else in the world can make this happen but you. 
                    Attempting to exceed our limits can generate a lot of temporary pain, but if we manage to mentally push past these boundaries and fight the sensation of giving up, 
                    we end up strengthening our minds and developing a winner’s mindset. Running is a great individual sport that allows us to consistently improve and challenge ourselves. 
                    And in doing so we will learn to pursue our desires and gain self-assurance. 
                </p>

                <p class="top-space">
                    If you have ever finished something that’s been on your shoulders for a long time, you will understand the great feeling relief and satisfaction in your body. 
                    This feeling comes whenever our mind feels like it accomplished something tough and decides to reward us. When we feel we have done something right, it is easy to 
                    appreciate ourselves and face the world with out head held high – because we think we deserve it. Accordingly, whenever we put in a good day’s work of running, we 
                    will feel the same thing. And the more we run and push ourselves, the more this feeling will stick with us.
