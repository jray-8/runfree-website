                            Be consistent! You may have noticed that most of the benefits of running can only be acquired over time if you run repeatedly. 
                            One hard run every couple weeks will not help you at all, as your body won’t have the constant stimulus needed to adapt to the process. 
                            You will likely just feel wrecked and need extra time to recover, without receiving any profit. It is better to do a short run 3-4 times per week 
                            than to do one long run every once in a while. Aim to run for some duration everyday. If your schedule does not permit this, then choose a few days 
                            spaced out throughout the week, and make sure you go for a run on these days. Even if you can only run on the weekends, stick to this program reliably; 
                            it’s better than nothing.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Drink water frequently to hydrate your muscles. The body requires a lot of water to function at an accelerated level, so make sure 
                            you are staying hydrated while running. Bring lots of water with you to the location you will be running at, so that you can take sips every time 
                            you pass your bags. Or at least make sure to drink plenty of water before and after your run. And if you’re running at a moderate to slow pace, there’s 
                            nothing wrong with running with a backpack on.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Wait at least 1-2 hours after a meal to start running, so you don’t develop cramps. If you only had a small snack, 30 minutes might be ok. 
                            However, make sure your not running on an empty stomach as you won’t have the proper energy to put in a good workout.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Wear loose, breathable clothing so you can move easily and won’t overheat during your run.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Buy new shoes when your feet start to hurt. A little soreness is typical, especially if you’re a beginner, but your feet should never feel extreme pain. 
                            Running wears out the soles of your shoes much faster than normal, so you may need to buy shoes more frequently to give your feet the proper support and padding they need.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Warm up and stretch <i>before</i> you start running! This will warm up and elongate your muscles, allowing you to move more freely when you run. 
                            If you forget to warm up, you muscles might start to knot during your run, and you will be more likely to get an injury. Simple quad, calf and hamstring stretches, 
                            along with rolling your shoulders, is often enough to get things started. A warmup may include a short 60 second jog, jumping jacks or really anything that gets your body moving.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Take deep, lengthy breathes to give your muscles the oxygen they need to function at this intensity. Try to find a rhythm in your breathing and stick to it. 
                            Mindfully observing your breathes on your first few runs can give you intuition as to what this rhythm feels like. Do not try to force your breathes in any 
                            particular way, let your body decide what’s best for you.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Relax your shoulders and let your body be loose. This will reduce the resistance in your body and cause you to soar forwards. A good trick is to roll your 
                            shoulders back a few times before you start running, and even a few times in the middle of a run if your arms get tight. The shoulders are usually the place 
                            where new runners store the most tension.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Move your arms as you run to increase the length of your stride and propel yourself forwards. Remember, we want to use as much energy as 
                            possible so that we are burning calories. There is no point in storing energy in our arms by holding them tight by our side.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Breathe in through your nose to prevents cramps.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <p>
                            Remember to stretch after every run, while your muscles are still warm, to get the blood flowing and speed up the recovery process. 
                            And not just your legs! Your arms, shoulders and back are also heavily involved in running. Stretching also increases your range of 
                            motion so that next time you run, you will have better form and it will feel easier. Finally, stretching prevents muscles from getting too tight 
                            or knotting, which will allow you to avoid injury and soreness the next day.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Get into a routine. Running at the same time everyday, like every morning or evening, can help you stick to your plan and make it easier to get out the door.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Progress just a little bit each day, but do this <i>every</i> day. Aim to run just a little further than you did the day before, or slightly longer, 
                            or run a bit harder. This will allow you to consistently improve strengthen your body. If you try to improve by too much too fast, your body will likely 
                            become overworked and need a few days to a week to recover. This will prevent you from further training and slow down your progress in the long term. 
                            Additionally, your likely to get an injury or strain your body when you attempt to do something way above your level. The body improves by adapting to 
                            small changes over time, so it will pay off more to push yourself a tiny bit than a ton. It may be difficult to keep your ego in check and try not to do 
                            too much at once, but it will definitely be worth it in the end. A good rule of thumb is to try to progress as slow as possible while still putting in more 
                            effort (in some way) than last time.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Track your progress by writing down what you did each day and how you felt afterwards. 
                            This will give you self-assurance and drive to beat your records when you read it, as well as a guide on what to improve on.
                        </p>

                            Make your easy days easy, so that your hard days can be hard. It is not realistic to push yourself every single day and expect that you are always using maximum effort. 
                            We need at least a day of rest in between our intense runs so that when we do push ourselves, we use all the power we have and improve our limits. This doesn’t mean you 
                            can’t run every day; it just means you should throw in some shorter, light runs in your schedule so that your hard runs are extra hard.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Set goals for improvement. Its difficult to get anywhere in life without a plan, and running is no different. 
                            Creating realistic and numeric goals for yourself can motivate you to work harder and move towards improvement.
