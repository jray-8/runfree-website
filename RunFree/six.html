                <p>
                    RunFree is a non-profit organization hoping to promote an active, healthy lifestyle through our love of running. We plan on inspiring others to join us and 
                    spread the merit of exercise and the abundant mental and physical benefits that come with it. We have discovered through practice and research the life-changing effects 
                    that a simple run or jog can have on your life, if done consistently. We find it truly amazing to watch people grow and advance into more confident and loving people. 
                    And this is what we are all about: unlocking our potential through hard work and exercise, so that we may reap the rewards of a positive mindset.

                <p>
                    <br>It is our goal to lead by example and show our community what can be achieved from maintaining a healthy mind and body. We embrace passion, support, 
                    friendly-competition and encouragement on our social media and website. For us, exercise is not an activity, but a process that leads to happiness, 
                    and one we wish to share with others. Our community loves to share motivational pictures and videos of their diet, their workouts, and their results. 
                    Join us here at RunFree and unlock the limitations of the mind.
