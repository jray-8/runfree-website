                    Once you have ran long enough to begin seizing its benefits, you will never want to stop. This is the stage at which you are going to 
                    want to think about timing yourself with your phone or purchasing a device, like a Fitbit, that will allow you to track your distance. 
                    Then, you will be able to record your progress numerically and start attempting to break your records. This is great motivation and can 
                    help bring you out of a drought. It’s also a good idea for intermediate runners to plan out their workout, so you can focus on improving 
                    specific skills or target certain benefits. Now, it’s time to continue your quest for a better life and take your running to the next level.

                    Consider interval training, where you run for a duration, say a minute, then break into an all-out sprint for the next 30 seconds, and finally 
                    end with a slow, restful jog for the next 2-3 minutes. Call this a single lap and repeat it about 4 to 6 times. As you get better at intervals, 
                    you can do more laps or adjust the durations to challenge yourself. For instance, you may be able to sprint for longer or want to reduce your rest 
                    time to make the workout more intense. Sprinting has certain advantages that running doesn’t because it works your body in a different way. 
                    Sprints shock your nervous system to increase mind-muscle connection and they use more muscle activation and mind power. This can be a great way of 
                    building muscle size or increasing the amount of effort you have available for running.

                <p>
                    You may also want to try hill training, which is a lot more physically demanding than running and will definitely work your leg muscles. 
                    Simply find a location with a hill and run laps around the area, ending with the hill. As you progress, you can run steeper hills or reduce the length 
                    of your track that is flat. This type of training will build the strength of your muscles and target your upper body more.

                    You can also find new and exciting locations to run, to keep things interesting. Check out new parks, trails, lakes, forests or cities near you. 
                    And, if you feel up to the challenge, you should try entering a race to see how it feels. Races are a great way to meet new people and have fun. 
                    Running in a race feels very different than a casual run. It is much harder, intense and exhilarating because you are competing with runners who are better than you. 
                    Trying to catch up to these people will help push you out of your comfort zone and give you an objective to aim for.

                    Don’t forget to keep doing your regular runs though, as they contain the most general benefits to your life and wellbeing. Feel free to mix and match different 
                    types of runs throughout the week to keep your schedule exciting. There are so many great ways to run, just keep putting one foot in front of the other and have 
                    fun in the process, or else none of this is worth it. On behalf of the RunFree team, good luck with you training and think positively!
